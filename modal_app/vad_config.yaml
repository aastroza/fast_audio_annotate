# NeMo VAD Configuration for Frame-based Voice Activity Detection
# This configuration is used for detecting speech segments in audio files

vad:
  parameters:
    # Window and shift lengths for VAD processing
    window_length_in_sec: 0.15  # Duration of each analysis window in seconds
    shift_length_in_sec: 0.01   # Shift between consecutive windows (frame rate)

    # Smoothing configuration
    smoothing: "median"  # Options: "median", "mean", or False
    overlap: 0.5         # Overlap ratio for smoothing (0.0 to 1.0)

    # Post-processing parameters for speech segment detection
    postprocessing:
      onset: 0.5              # Threshold to start speech segment (0.0 to 1.0)
                              # Higher = more conservative, fewer false positives
                              # Lower = more sensitive, may include more non-speech

      offset: 0.5             # Threshold to end speech segment (0.0 to 1.0)
                              # Higher = segments end sooner
                              # Lower = segments continue longer

      min_duration_on: 0.1    # Minimum speech segment duration in seconds
                              # Segments shorter than this are discarded

      min_duration_off: 0.3   # Minimum silence duration in seconds
                              # Silence shorter than this doesn't split segments

      filter_speech_first: true  # Apply speech filtering before segmentation

# Recommended presets for different scenarios:
#
# Conservative (fewer segments, higher quality):
#   onset: 0.7
#   offset: 0.7
#   min_duration_on: 0.3
#   min_duration_off: 0.5
#
# Balanced (default):
#   onset: 0.5
#   offset: 0.5
#   min_duration_on: 0.1
#   min_duration_off: 0.3
#
# Sensitive (more segments, captures hesitations):
#   onset: 0.3
#   offset: 0.3
#   min_duration_on: 0.05
#   min_duration_off: 0.2
